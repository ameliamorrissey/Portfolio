# Pursuit Study

This is from my summer internship with the Duke Clinical Research Institute 
and North Carolina State University. I worked on this project with two other 
students, but wrote the R code independently. Please note that this code is 
our exploration of relationships, not something I consider polished or neat. 
Here, we were looking back at a study from the 1990s submitted to the FDA to 
pass a hypertension medication and looking at the effects of the treatment on 
the time until death or a myocardial infarction (MI, or heart attack). We 
originally concluded that the treatment was did not affect the time until 
death or mi, but later found an error in our analysis because the data did not 
include second mi or death for people who had an mi. However, this is a good 
example of my use of survival curves, cox proportional hazards, and Kaplan 
Mayer curves.

Note: I am not able to include data due to HIPPA confidentiality of 
medical data, so my code will not run. However, I included screen shots of 
some of the graphs that I produced in this analysis.
